Pillar Code Test

The associated file is the test for the Pillar routine.

The point was to develop a system that would manage the production of codes for newspaper ads which could be 
viewed by the end user.

This routine presents a screen which will take
  1) a newspaper name
  2) a text based ad for that newspaper.
  
The system allows for the incorporation of multiple ads (1 at a time).  These ads are saved.


I built the system as it is to permit a "1 file, no configuration" set of parameters.  If i were to build it for usage, 
i would likely implement it as a Javascript front end that connected to a MySql server.  I'd be happy to talk about this.
